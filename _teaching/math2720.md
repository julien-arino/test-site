I have not taught this course in quite a while, but when I did, I used the [following booklet](/assets/pdf/courses/math2720_booklet.pdf), which contains a wealth of somewhat outdated information (for tests). Note that slides follow [Marsen and Tromba](https://www.amazon.ca/Vector-Calculus-University-Jerrold-Marsden/dp/1429215089), which is a little different from the book used by most of my colleagues.
