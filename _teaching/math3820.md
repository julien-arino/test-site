MATH 3820 (Introduction to Mathematical Modelling) was a course that existed prior to the currrent MATH 3610 (with the same time) and the former MATH 2140. Here are some slides I used when teaching this course. Some "chapters" followed FYM Wan's book [Mathematical Models and their Analysis](https://books.google.ca/books/about/Mathematical_Models_and_Their_Analysis.html?id=kN8nAQAAIAAJ), which, while it feels a little "retro", remains a good general introduction to modelling problems.

        <li><a href="{{ pdf.path }}">{{ pdf.basename }}</a></li>
    {% endif %}
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</ul>

Note that the code used matlab. I have now switched to using R and might add code to do this at a later stage. Once I track it down, I will also post the matlab code.
