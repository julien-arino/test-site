Because of work on COVID-19 response, I have not posted anything in over two years. Because of an upcoming summer school, I have to revisit some work on the use of data scraped from Internet and in particular, ensure that the code still works. The revised code is located [here](https://github.com/julien-arino/modelling-with-data) and supersedes the old code. The paper itself is located here: [Mathematical epidemiology in a data-rich world](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2019.12.008), [*Infectious Disease Modelling*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/infectious-disease-modelling) **5**: 161-188, 2020.
