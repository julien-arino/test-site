When working with students and postdocs, I often provide "skeletons", i.e., canonical examples of code that illustrate something that I want them to do in another context. Example: running some code in parallel. Here, I will carry out a very simple and naive sensitivity analysis of the value of the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ in the basic Kermack and McKendrick SIR model.

First, we need the function that we will evaluate for a given point in parameter space. Note that we pass parameters as a list rather than an ordered t-uple of parameters; this allows to not have to worry about the order in which parameters are presented.

{% highlight r %}
R0 = function(p) {
  return(p$beta*p$S0/p$gamma)
}
{% endhighlight %}

The following function converts one or several parameter values given in the list by `lapply` or `parLapply` into a value of $\mathcal{R}_0$. Note the little trick, which allows to set as many parameters as are provided in the element of the list received as argument.

{% highlight r %}
one_run_R0 = function(p,param) {
  for (pp in names(p))
    param[[pp]] = p[[pp]]
  return(R0(param))
}
{% endhighlight %}

Set up parameters by default. If not changed by the function above, they take these values.

{% highlight r %}
param = list()
param$beta = 1e-6
param$S0 = 10000
param$gamma = 1/4.5 # Average duration of infection
{% endhighlight %}

Set up the list of parameters that are going to vary. For illustration, we do 10,000 computations for varying values of $\beta$, 10,000 for varying values of $S_0$ and 10,000 simulations for varying values of both $\beta$ and $S_0$.

{% highlight r %}
nb_sims = 10000 # nb of simulations of each type
param_vary = list()
for (i in 1:nb_sims) {
  param_vary[[i]] = list()
  param_vary[[i]]$beta = runif(1, min = 1e-9, max = 1e-4)
}
for (i in (nb_sims+1):(2*nb_sims)) {
  param_vary[[i]] = list()
  param_vary[[i]]$S0 = runif(1, min = 1000, max = 100000)
}
for (i in (2*nb_sims+1):(3*nb_sims)) {
  param_vary[[i]] = list()
  param_vary[[i]]$beta = runif(1, min = 1e-9, max = 1e-4)
  param_vary[[i]]$S0 = runif(1, min = 1000, max = 100000)
}
{% endhighlight %}

The code can be run in parallel or iteratively. Note one interesting quirk: the function argument to `parLapply` is called `fun`, while that to `lapply` is called `FUN`. You have to love `R`. One core is set aside to avoid rendering the computer completely unresponsive; on a cluster with head node, you would of course be able to devote all cores to computations. (But then again, on a cluster with head node, you might also be using a scheduler.)

{% highlight r %}
RUN_PARALLEL = TRUE
if (RUN_PARALLEL) {
  # Detect number of cores, use all but 1
  no_cores <- parallel::detectCores() - 1
  # Initiate cluster
  tictoc::tic()
  cl <- parallel::makeCluster(no_cores)
  # Export needed variables
  parallel::clusterExport(cl,
                c("R0",
                  "one_run_R0",
                  "param"))
  # Run computation
  result = parallel::parLapply(cl = cl, X = param_vary,
                               fun =  function(x) one_run_R0(x,param))
  # Stop cluster
  parallel::stopCluster(cl)
  tictoc::toc()
} else {
  tictoc::tic()
  result = lapply(X = param_vary,
                  FUN = function(x) one_run_R0(x,param))
  tictoc::toc()
}
{% endhighlight %}

Last little piece: let us plot the range of values taken by $\mathcal{R}_0$ when the various parameters are varied, to show sensitivity of $\mathcal{R}_0$.

{% highlight r %}
result = unlist(result)
result.df = data.frame(beta = result[1:nb_sims],
                       S0 = result[(nb_sims+1):(2*nb_sims)],
                       beta_S0 = result[(2*nb_sims+1):(3*nb_sims)])
boxplot(result.df)
{% endhighlight %}
