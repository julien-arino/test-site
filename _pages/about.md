I am a Professor and 2021-2024 Faculty of Science Research Chair in Fundamental Science with the Department of Mathematics, a member of the [Data Science NEXUS](http://www.sci.umanitoba.ca/data-science-nexus/) and a faculty member of the [VADA Graduate Training Program](http://vada.cs.umanitoba.ca/), all at the [University of Manitoba](https://umanitoba.ca/). I am also a member of the [Canadian Centre for Disease Modelling](http://cdm.yorku.ca/), the [Canadian COVID-19 Mathematical Modelling Task Force](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/Mathematical-Modelling-COVID-19) and three of the NSERC Emerging Infectious Disease consortium projects (CANMOD, MfPH and OMNI/RÉUNIS).

My research deals primarily with population movement in epidemiology and ecology, with particular interest on the spatio-temporal spread of infectious diseases. In this context, I am interested in two main aspects: the relationship between mobility modalities and the fast global spread of infectious pathogens, as well as the effect of interconnections of public health systems with a variety of health practices. I use mathematical modelling to consider the risk of importation of disease to various public health entities. I have also dabbled with other mathematical biology problems.

As part of my work, I have become more and more interested in the use of data in my models, hence my membership in VADA and the Data Science NEXUS.

From 22 to 26 May 2023, Kang-Ling Liao, Stéphanie Portet and I are co-organising the sixth edition of the Computational and Mathematical Population Dynamics conference (CMPD6) in Winnipeg; see details [here](https://cmpd6.github.io/).
