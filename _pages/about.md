I am a Professor and 2021-2024 Faculty of Science Research Chair in Fundamental Science with the Department of Mathematics at the [University of Manitoba](https://umanitoba.ca/).

My research is in mathematical biology, with particular focus on the role of movement in epidemiology and epizootiology. As part of my work, I have become more and more interested in data scientific aspects. 

I teach mathematical modelling and mathematical epidemiology in [a variety of settings](https://julien-arino.github.io/teaching/) and have recorded some lectures in that context, which I post to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcHuL1H_0LmY5C_daUyfyA).
