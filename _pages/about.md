I am a Professor and 2021-2024 Faculty of Science Research Chair in Fundamental Science with the Department of Mathematics, a member of the [Data Science NEXUS](http://www.sci.umanitoba.ca/data-science-nexus/) and a faculty member of the [VADA Graduate Training Program](http://vada.cs.umanitoba.ca/), all at the [University of Manitoba](https://umanitoba.ca/). I am also a member of the [Canadian Centre for Disease Modelling](http://cdm.yorku.ca/), the [Canadian COVID-19 Mathematical Modelling Task Force](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/Mathematical-Modelling-COVID-19) and three of the NSERC Emerging Infectious Disease consortium projects (CANMOD, MfPH and OMNI/RÉUNIS).

My research deals primarily with population movement in epidemiology and ecology, with particular interest on the spatio-temporal spread of infectious diseases. In this context, I am interested in two main aspects: the relationship between mobility modalities and the fast global spread of infectious pathogens, as well as the effect of interconnections of public health systems with a variety of health practices. I use mathematical modelling to consider the risk of importation of disease to various public health entities. I have also dabbled with other mathematical biology problems.

As part of my work, I have become more and more interested in the use of data in my models, hence my membership in VADA and the Data Science NEXUS. I have also started to record some lectures, which I post to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcHuL1H_0LmY5C_daUyfyA). Nothing super elaborate, mostly lectures about mathematical epidemiology as well as about a Mathematics of Data Science course I teach. 

From 23 to 27 May 2023, Kang-Ling Liao, Stéphanie Portet and I are co-organising the [Sixth Computational and Mathematical Population Dynamics conference (CMPD6)](https://cmpd6.github.io/) in Winnipeg.
